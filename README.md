# Movie-Analysis-with-Wikipedia-using-Tableau-
I built an interactive Tableau dashboard that explores movie data from multiple angles. With just a search or selection, you can:

See genre popularity with the number of titles in each category

View the corresponding movie titles within that genre

Select any movie title to instantly see the genre(s) it belongs to

Discover the top 5 actors for each genre

Compare IMDb vote counts for highly rated titles

Access direct Wikipedia search results for quick context

This two-way interactivity makes the dashboard more than just a visualization—it’s a tool that can help studios, streaming services, and marketers uncover patterns in audience demand, genre performance, and actor popularity. It’s a demonstration of how raw data can be transformed into actionable insights that support decision-making.
